Brief about the design:-

Have made use of maven to download the dependencies part

Name of the classes and their methods are self explanatory, as per the design have designated BattleArea to each player, list of targets for the opponent and the opponent
BattleArea has collection of Battleships inside, along with their Location.
Every class designed in a way to have single responsibility

Instruction to run the code:-

Just run the BattleProcessor.java file that will internally take care of reading input from the input file and printing it to console.  


Assumptions:-

Taking Height of battleship in number as provided in the same way in the input example present in the question (BattleShip_Game_V3.pdf) shared with me

Assuming that the limit of width and height of battlearea and battleship will remain in the limit as mentioned in the question(BattleShip_Game_V3.pdf) shared with me
